<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> High resolution in space and time is often essential for studying life under a microscope. Fast 2D microscopy has been routine for decades (limited by signal levels or detector speed), but 3D is much slower, typically limited by the focusing method. Here we show that remote refocus

removes focusing as a speed limit while adding minimal drawbacks, and we propose that remote refocus is the right technique for most high-speed 3D microscopy applications. To our knowledge, there is no commercial implementation of remote refocus, so we provide a modular high-performance design to enable others to build their own. We also present the concept, method and rules of remote refocus to help others improve or modify our design. Our design gives camera-limited speed (&gt;4.2x10<sup>8</sup> voxels/s) and  diffraction-limited resolution (&lt;270 nm) over a user-specified volume up to 200x200x60 &mu;m<sup>3</sup>. We demonstrate the speed and flexibility of remote refocus using a variety of live biological samples with 3D rates ranging from 2.5-50 volumes per second, 3-27x faster than standard focusing methods.</p>

<h3>Intended audience</h3>
<p class="abstract">Microscopy users, developers, engineers and scientists interested in fast volumetric imaging at high resolution. We tried to write the article in an accessible and straighforward fashion; our aim is to lower the barrier to making a good remote refocus, and allow readers to easily replicate our design, or design and build their own with confidence.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>Remote refocus removes the primary speed limit of 3D microscopy, with minimal drawbacks</h4>

<p>Revealing the 3D dynamics of living samples is the greatest strength of optical microscopy. To capture these dynamics, we assemble 4D spatiotemporal information from a series of 3D spatial measurements, which are in turn assembled from a series of 2D images

2D imaging at "video rate" or above (20-30 frames per second) has been standard in the field for decades

<p>Light flux from the sample sets a fundamental limit on temporal resolution; even a detector with infinite speed and zero noise must wait until it detects enough photoelectrons to form a decent image

Photoelectron-limited operation is rarely achieved due to hardware limitations, which in 2D imaging is often the camera speed (pixels per second and frames per second) and in 3D imaging is typically the axial (Z) focusing mechanism.</p>

<p>In our hands, RR eliminates the 3D bottleneck, pushing axial focusing speed beyond camera-limited speed (or photoelectron-limited speed, for dim samples). Remote refocusing's drawbacks are minimal: lower optical efficiency due to four extra lenses in the emission path, and an extended depth of field at the highest volumetric frame rates. Whilst lower efficiency is never desirable, we note that additional lenses in the emission path are tolerable and typical in many microscopy setups, such as spinning disk units, external filter wheels, etc. Elongated depth of field is either a blessing or a curse depending on the application, but only becomes relevant at the highest volumetric rates, when RR piezo settling times exceed the rolling time of our camera (see <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section for details).<p>

push axial focusing speed to infinity, but reduce camera-limited imaging speed. Multifocus microscopy's X, Y, and Z fields of view can't be adjusted, which either wastes voxels per second or requires slow conventional focusing, unless the sample happens to perfectly fill the (fixed) imaging volume. Light field microscopy yields even fewer voxels per second than multifocus microscopy, because it measures multiple camera pixels to characterize one Nyquist-limited voxel (other drawbacks include degraded resolution and mandatory post-processing). These techniques are therefore faster than RR when the bottleneck is RR focusing time, but slower when the bottleneck is the camera. In our experience with well-engineered RR fluorescence microscopes, the bottleneck is always the camera. Multifocal and light field microscopy also combine awkwardly with powerful 3D techniques like light-sheet or spinning-disk microscopy, which combine elegantly with remote refocus [TODO: MAYBE TWO CITATIONS HERE?].
</p>

<p>Given the importance of fast 3D imaging, and the power and flexibility of RR, we're surprised RR isn't more popular. The <a href="./appendix.html#History">history</a> of RR shows many clever technical innovations, but few biological applications, and no commercial implementations. We speculate RR suffers from two problems: surprising pitfalls during design and construction, and a lack of advertising. We hope our design empowers builders to painlessly, confidently make their own RR, and we hope data like Figure 1 (high-resolution 3D images of <em>C. elegans</em> at 20 volumes per second) and Figure 2 (high-resolution 3D images of yeast flowing in a microfluidic channel at 50 volumes per second) will entice microscope users to try RR for their high-speed imaging challenges. Most of all, we hope to inspire microscope manufacturers to commercialize and disseminate remote refocus as the "gold standard" solution for fast 3D imaging problems.</p>

<h4>The why and how of remote refocus</h4>

<p></p>
<p>The motivation for fast focusing is clear, but the advantages (or indeed, the meaning) of ‘remote’ refocusing may not be obvious. Standard microscopes select their image plane (dotted line, Figure 3a) by moving either the objective lens or the sample. This is convenient and simple, but the high inertia of these elements requires a high-power Z-actuator to achieve agile motion, which combines awkwardly with typical crowded multi-objective turrets. High-resolution imaging requires immersion media like oil or water, which couples rapid vibration of the objective to the coverslip, disturbing the sample and blurring the image at high focusing speeds (Figure 3c). In our experience, any optimization to improve this focusing speed 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2687" title="Instant super-resolution imaging in live cells and embryos via analog image processing; Andrew G. York, Panagiotis Chandris, Damian Dalle Nogare, Jeffrey Head, Peter Wawrzusin, Robert S. Fischer, Ajay Chitnis &amp; Hari Shroff; Nature Methods 10, 1122–1126 (2013)">York 2013</a>]

is highly dependent on both the sample and the objective lens, and must be constantly re-optimized to maintain high performance.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Typical focusing vs. remote refocus at moderate and high acquisition speeds.</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> Typical focusing; to change the focal plane (horizontal dotted line), the objective moves with respect to the sample. Immersion oil or water (blue) couples this motion to the sample. <strong>(b)</strong> Remote re-focus; the primary objective and sample don't move during focusing, which prevents mechanical coupling. <strong>(c)</strong> At high speeds, typical focusing with immersion fluid disturbs the sample, degrading or destroying 3D image quality. <strong>(d)</strong> Remote refocus allows fast 3D images because the sample is isolated from focus-related motion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>Refocusing remotely leaves the sample and primary objective stationary (Figure 3b), isolating the sample from mechanical disturbance at high speed (Figure 3d). Because the moving part is now outside the microscope, optimizations for fast focusing become indpendent of the sample and the primary objective, greatly simplifying life for the microscope's user. The 'bolt-on' nature of the module doesn't interfere with the normal operation of the microscope, and even provides a convenient space for a fast external filter wheel without the need for an additional telescope (which is commonly added for this purpose).</p>

<p>A detailed description of RR theory is elegantly presented in the original paper

and will not be re-visited here. We do however provide a straightforward <a href="./appendix.html#Concept, rules and simulation">concept, rules and simulation</a> section in the <a href="./appendix.html">Appendix</a> for those looking to build their own RR, which highlights potential pitfalls. We also give a brief summary of the <a href="./appendix.html#History">history</a> of the technique which may help the reader frame its use in the field of microscopy and understand how the RR version presented here fits into the story.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<h4>Large volumes with uncompromised resolution</h4>

<p>Our remote refocus is designed to couple to a typical microscope stand and produce diffraction-limited images using a 60x 1.45 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion primary objective (Figure 4). Because our design's Z-drive can make small steps (0.1-1 &mu;m) faster than the rolling time of modern sCMOS cameras at full field (&lt;10 ms), the system imaging speed is either camera-limited or photoelectron-limited in this regime. This section describes the optical performance; for a detailed description of the module, see the <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> and <a href="./appendix.html#Build">build</a> sections of the <a href="./appendix.html">Appendix</a>.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 5: RR delivers minimal distortion across the 3D field of view.</strong> Images of an engineered flourescent target (Argolight SIM slide) show the remote refocus's large (200x200x60 &mu;m<sup>3</sup>) imaging volume, with minimal distortion and clearly resolvable line pairs separated by 750 nm across the whole volume. We used the microscope Z-drive to de-focus the sample, and then the RR piezo to re-focus, scanning the full 3D design volume of the instrument. Note the figure is interactive, allowing the reader to tune both the microscope objective and RR piezo position to inspect 3D image quality.</figcaption>

<p>To quantify resolution, we translated finely spaced resolution lines through the field of view. Consistent with our expections of diffraction-limited performance within the design volume, the RR does not degrade resolution, easily resolving lines separated by 270 nm across the entire volume (Figure 6), and 240 nm near the center (see <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section for details). Note the classic Rayleigh limit \(\frac{0.61\lambda}{NA}\) predicts ~230nm resolution using this filter cube, which even unmodified microscopes rarely achieve in our experience.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 6: RR delivers uncompromised resolution across the design volume.</strong> Finely separated flourescent lines (Argolight SIM slide) show the resolution of our RR design. The pattern consists of 14 line pairs that range from fully overlapped (top) to a separation of 390 nm (bottom) in 30 nm steps. The data shows a 200x200x60 &mu;m<sup>3</sup> volume with resolving power better than 270nm line separation, and better than 240 nm in the central volume. We used the microscope Z-drive to de-focus the sample, and then the RR piezo to re-focus, scanning the full 3D design volume of the instrument. Note the figure is interactive, allowing the reader to tune both the microscope objective and RR piezo position to inspect 3D image quality.</figcaption>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Volumetric imaging capability of remote refocus illustrated via 3D structures on the Argolight SIM slide.</strong> The pattern consists of a 3D array of 9x9x9 rings separated by 5 &mu;m in X, Y, and Z. We acquired the data by focusing the microscope Z-drive onto the top plane, and then used the RR piezo to take the Z-stack. The stack was then processed with ImageJ to give 3D projections from various angles (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">acquisition</a> section for details).</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Much faster than standard focusing, especially with non-rigid and delicate samples</h4>

<p>Having established excellent image quality, we next measured the speed of our remote refocus (Figure 8) using a series of standard samples: a glass slide with chrome graticule (very rigid), a glass slide with agarose pad and coverslip (semi-rigid), a plastic dish with coverslip bottom (semi-flexible) and a microfluidic chip (very flexible). We compare our RR's focusing speed vs. standard focusing methods: the motorized primary objective of a premium microscope stand, and a high-performance Z-piezo stage insert. For each sample, we set the microscope stand primary objective to an initial 10 &mu;m de-focus, and used each device in turn to focus the sample and then return to its initial position. The allocated focusing times for the RR piezo (15 ms) and the piezo stage insert (50 ms) were determined by their measured 10 &mu;m step-and-settle times (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">acquisition</a> section for details). The focusing time of the motorized objective (~100 ms) is bottlenecked by serial port communication latency (the primary bottleneck for most microscopy systems; we encourage anyone interested in fast acquisition to learn how to use an analog-out card).</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 8: RR delivers faster focusing and less sample disturbance vs. standard techniques, for a range of standard samples.</strong> 

Each column of the figure shows one sample type. The top panel is a photo of the sample, showing how it was mounted. The middle panel shows a 1000 fps video of focusing performance for a 10 &mu;m motion of the microscope stand (first motion), the piezo stage insert (second motion), and the RR (third motion) for that sample. The bottom panel shows a kymograph of image intensity vs. space (left/right) and time (up/down) of a central horizontal line of pixels from the corresponding video. The video illustrates the lateral sample disturbance due to each method, and the kymograph highlights the axial focusing speed. Note that the figure is interactive, allowing the reader to switch between displaying either: <strong>(1)</strong> a very rigid graticule (left) and a very flexible microfluidic chip (right), or <strong>(2)</strong> a somewhat rigid coverslip/agarose pad/glass slide sample (left, like the one shown in Figure 1) and a somewhat flexible plastic dish with bonded 170 &mu;m coverglass and a sprinkling of aluminum particles for imaging contrast (right).

This text should probably be in the body rather than the caption, and I don't want to delete it until I'm sure:

The figure is interactive and consists of 4 sub figures that are paired: (graticule + microfluidic chip) and (agarose pad + dish), where each sub figure consists of 3 panels: a video of focusing at 1000fps (top), intensity vs time for a slice of the video (middle) and a photo of the sample (bottom).  The microfluidic chip consists of a finely featured PDMS device bonded to standard 170&mu;m coverglass and was designed and tested for high resolution microscopy of live biology in 4D. Here the microscope and stage insert are unable to focus on the sample at high speed due to the coupling of the oil which causes the sample to flex, where as the remote re-focus can operate unimpeded and shows huge (27x) gains in speed. The agarose slide consists of a standard glass slide with a ~1mm agarose pad and <em>C. elegans</em> under a standard 170&mu;m coverslip. The relatively slow microscope stand was able to focus on the worm in a similar way to the graticule (some xy motion) but because the agarose is not fully rigid the faster stage insert could not reach a sharp focus in the time interval (the remote re-focus was unimpeded). The dish sample consists of a premium manufactured plastic dish with bonded 170&mu;m converglass and a sprinkling of aluminium particles for imaging. This sample was more flexible than the agarose pad and so the microscope and stage insert struggled to find sharp focus and predictably the remote re-focus was unaffected.</figcaption>

</figure>
<p></p>

<p>The graticule is an opaque chrome mask deposited on a small, thick glass slide, supported by a larger solid metal slide. It is extremely rigid, allowing good focus during the microscope stand's motion (100 ms) and the piezo stage insert's motion (50 ms). The microscope stand causes some lateral vibration during focusing, but the piezo stage insert performs well. This is a best-case scenario for the piezo insert; in our experience, most samples are much less rigid. However, the RR motion (15 ms) is still ~3x faster than the piezo stage in this case, because its design allows room for a larger, more powerful piezo, moving a small, predictable mass.</p>

<p>
For the graticule and agarose slides, all three focusing methods were able to reach focus in the allocated times, with the microscope showing significant lateral motion but the piezo stage insert and RR both focusing as expected. Because these samples are stiff and well clamped the main benefit of the RR in this regime is the physical decoupling of the fast z-drive from the microscope which allows a wide range of actuators to be considered. In this design the &lt;15 ms step and settle of the RR (10&mu;m jump) is achieved by using a bulky piezo unit that does not fit on every microscope platform and occupies a large space that interferes with the nosepiece automation and neighbouring objectives. Because the RR piezo unit is large, powerful and specifically optimised for the RR objective it offers an immediate 3x gain in speed compared to the other methods we tested, regardless of the sample. It should also be noted that another major practical benefit of this architecture is that the RR piezo, camera and light source can all be triggered and controlled by high speed analogue signals which aviods the communication latency that often cripples good temporal performance in focusing.</p>


<p>For the dish and microfluidic chip samples the advantages of the RR are substantial. The microscope is able to reach focus on the dish by virture of being ~7x slower, which gives the oil and sample just enough time to settle (although the xy motion is still noticable). The stage insert however is only ~3x slower and so extra settle time must be added to the acquisition to compensate for the motion coupled to the sample and reach a sharp focus. With the flexible microfluidic chip the coupling of the oil is more detrimental and incapacitates both the microscope and stage inserts ability to focus on the normal time scales (50-110ms). In a separate test the settle time was found to be ~400ms which is ~27x slower than the RR. The RR naturally performs as well with the dish and microfluidc chip as with any other sample giving a speed advantage in the 3-27x range for the samples demonstrated here and larger benefits expected in a water dipping regime where this technique could revolutionise z stack acquisition.</p>

<h4>Dynamic 4D biology</h4>

<p>Having established both excellent optomechanical performance of the remote re-focus and clear speed advantages of using it with a range of standard samples some readily available living organisms were identified and imaged. Here we show the RR in action with waterborne Protozoa freely moving in a 3D volume at up to 14 volumes/s (Figure 9), C. elegans freely roaming around on an agarose pad at up to 20 volumes/s (Figure 1) and yeast cells flowing in microfluidic channels at up to 50 volumes/s (Figures 2 and 9).</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>Remote re-focus gives the highest spatiotemporal resolution in many applications</h4>

TODO: Andy editorial
<p></p>
<p>Many applications of high resolution optical microscopy of live organisms could benefit from a decoupling of the focusing mechanism from the sample space by using the remote re-focus method, which is particularly relevant when sensitive or flexible mounting of the sample is inherent and fast 4D acquisitions are required. Here we clearly outline the concept, method and rules for those wishing to design and build their own RR system and provide a brief overview of the history of the technique.</p>

<p>A high performance RR arrangement is presented that may be easily replicated with a detailed discussion of the associated design choices and alignment procedure. The system is shown to have excellent optical properties over a huge 200x200x60&mu;m volume with good corresponding mechanical stability and fast motion dynamics that result in a maximally performant photon limited system when using a modern sCMOS camera at full field. The benefits of RR are demonstrated using typical samples where it clearly outperforms standard focusing methods with speed gains in the 3-27x range. The imaging capabilities of the system are then shown through a series of live biological samples with speeds ranging from 2.5-50 volumes/s.</p>
