<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> High resolution in space and time is often essential for studying life under a microscope. Fast 2D microscopy has been routine for decades, limited by signal levels or detector speed, but 3D is much slower and is typically limited by the focusing method. Here we show that remote refocus

removes focusing as a speed limit while adding minimal drawbacks, and we propose that remote refocus is the right technique for most high-speed high-resolution 3D microscopy applications, especially fluorescence. To our knowledge, there is no commercial implementation of remote refocus, so we provide a modular high-performance design to enable others to build their own. We also present the concept, method and rules of remote refocus to help others improve or modify our design. Our intrument gives camera-limited speed (&gt;4.2x10<sup>8</sup> voxels/s) and  diffraction-limited resolution (&lt;270 nm) over a user-specified volume up to 200x200x60 &mu;m<sup>3</sup>. We demonstrate the speed and flexibility of remote refocus using a variety of live biological samples with 3D rates ranging from 2.5-50 volumes per second.</p>

<h3>Intended audience</h3>
<p class="abstract">Microscopy users, developers, engineers and scientists interested in fast volumetric imaging at high resolution. We tried to write the article in an accessible and straighforward fashion; our aim is to lower the barrier to making a good remote refocus, and allow readers to easily replicate our design, or design and build their own with confidence.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>Remote refocus removes the primary speed limit of 3D microscopy, with minimal drawbacks</h4>

<p>Revealing the 3D dynamics of living samples is arguably the greatest strength of optical microscopy. To capture these dynamics, we assemble 4D spatiotemporal information from a series of 3D spatial measurements, which are in turn assembled from a series of 2D images

In practice, photoelectron-limited operation is rarely achieved due to hardware limitations, which in 2D imaging is often the camera speed (pixels per second) and in 3D imaging is typically the axial (Z) focusing mechanism.</p>

 RR eliminates the 3D bottleneck, reducing axial focusing time below either the camera readout time for bright samples or the photoelectron-limited exposure time for dim specimins. Remote refocusing's drawbacks are minimal: lower optical efficiency due to four extra lenses in the emission path, and an extended depth of field at the highest volumetric frame rates. Whilst lower efficiency is never desirable, we note that additional lenses in the emission path are tolerable and typical in many microscopy setups, such as spinning disk units, external filter wheels, etc. Elongated depth of field is either a benefit or a handicap depending on the application, but only becomes relevant at the highest volumetric rates, when RR piezo settling times exceed the rolling time of our camera (see <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section for details).<p>

<p>In contrast, multifocus

completely eliminate axial focusing time, but reduce camera-limited imaging speed (i.e. voxels per second). Multifocus microscopy's X, Y, and Z fields of view can't be adjusted to match the sample, which either loses pixels by measuring empty voxels in undersized samples, or requires slow mechanical motion for oversize samples. Light field microscopy yields even fewer voxels per second than multifocus microscopy, because it measures multiple camera pixels to characterize one Nyquist-limited voxel, with other drawbacks including degraded resolution and mandatory post-processing. These techniques are therefore faster than RR when the bottleneck is RR focusing time, but slower when the bottleneck is the pixels-per-second rate of the camera. In our experience with well-engineered RR fluorescence microscopes, the bottleneck is the camera in most applications. In addition, multifocal and light field microscopy combine awkwardly with powerful 3D techniques like light-sheet or spinning-disk microscopy, which couple elegantly with remote refocus

<p>Given the importance of fast 3D microscopy, and the power and flexibility of RR, we're surprised RR isn't more popular. The <a href="./appendix.html#History">history</a> of RR shows many clever technical innovations, but few biological applications, and no commercial implementations. We speculate RR suffers from two problems: surprising pitfalls during design and construction, and a lack of advertising. We hope our design empowers builders to confidently make their own RR, and present <em>C. elegans</em> imaged at 20 volumes per second (Figure 1) and flowing yeast imaged at 50 volumes per second (Figure 2) to entice microscope users to try RR for their own high-speed imaging challenges. Most of all, we hope to inspire microscope manufacturers to commercialize and disseminate remote refocus as the "gold standard" solution for fast 3D fluorescence microscopy.</p>

<h4>The why and how of remote refocus</h4>

<p></p>
<p>The motivation for fast focusing is clear, but the advantages (or indeed, the meaning) of ‘remote’ refocusing may not be obvious. Standard microscopes select their image plane (dotted line, Figure 3a) by moving either the objective lens or the sample. This is convenient and simple, but the high inertia of these elements requires a high-power Z-actuator to achieve agile motion, which combines awkwardly with typical crowded multi-objective turrets. In addition, high-resolution imaging requires immersion media like oil or water, which couples rapid vibration of the objective to the coverslip, disturbing the sample and blurring the image at high focusing speeds (Figure 3c). In our experience, any optimization to improve this focusing speed 

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2687" title="Instant super-resolution imaging in live cells and embryos via analog image processing; Andrew G. York, Panagiotis Chandris, Damian Dalle Nogare, Jeffrey Head, Peter Wawrzusin, Robert S. Fischer, Ajay Chitnis &amp; Hari Shroff; Nature Methods 10, 1122–1126 (2013)">York 2013, Sup. Fig. 6</a>]

is highly dependent on both the sample and the objective lens, and must be re-optimized to maintain high performance whenever these change.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Typical focusing vs. remote refocus at moderate and high acquisition speeds.</strong> <strong>(a)</strong> Typical focusing; to change the focal plane (horizontal dotted line), the objective moves with respect to the sample. Immersion oil or water (blue) couples this motion to the sample. <strong>(b)</strong> Remote re-focus; the primary objective and sample don't move during focusing, which prevents mechanical coupling. <strong>(c)</strong> At high speeds, typical focusing with immersion fluid disturbs the sample, degrading or even preventing 3D imaging. <strong>(d)</strong> Remote refocus allows fast 3D images because the sample is isolated from focus-related motion.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>Refocusing remotely leaves the sample and primary objective stationary (Figure 3b), isolating the sample from mechanical disturbance at high speed (Figure 3d). Because the moving part is now outside the microscope, optimizations for fast focusing become indpendent of the sample and the primary objective, greatly simplifying life for the microscope's user. The 'bolt-on' nature of the module doesn't interfere with the normal operation of the microscope, and even provides a convenient space for a fast external filter wheel without the need for an additional telescope (which is commonly added for this purpose).</p>

<p>A detailed description of RR theory is elegantly presented in the original paper

and will not be re-visited here. We do however provide a straightforward <a href="./appendix.html#Concept_rules_and_simulation">concept, rules and simulation</a> section in the <a href="./appendix.html">Appendix</a> for those looking to build their own RR, which highlights potential pitfalls. We also give a brief summary of the <a href="./appendix.html#History">history</a> of the technique which may help the reader frame its use in the field of microscopy and understand how the RR version presented here fits into the story.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<h4>Large volumes with uncompromised resolution</h4>

<p>We designed our remote refocus to couple to a typical microscope stand and produce diffraction-limited images using a 60x 1.45 numerical aperture (NA) oil immersion primary objective (Figure 4). Because our design's Z-drive can make small steps (0.1-1 &mu;m) faster than the rolling time of modern sCMOS cameras at full field (&lt;10 ms), the system imaging speed is either camera-limited or photoelectron-limited in this regime. This section describes the optical performance; for a detailed description of the module, see the <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> and <a href="./appendix.html#Build">build</a> sections of the <a href="./appendix.html">Appendix</a>.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 5: RR delivers minimal distortion across the 3D field of view.</strong> Images of an engineered flourescent target (Argolight SIM slide) show the remote refocus's large (200x200x60 &mu;m<sup>3</sup>) imaging volume, with minimal distortion and clearly resolvable line pairs separated by 750 nm across the whole volume. We used the microscope Z-drive to de-focus the sample, and then the RR piezo to re-focus, scanning the full 3D design volume of the instrument.

<p>To quantify resolution, we translated finely spaced resolution lines through the field of view. Consistent with our expections of diffraction-limited performance within the design volume, the RR does not degrade resolution, easily resolving lines separated by 270 nm across the entire volume (Figure 6), and 240 nm near the center (see <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section for details). Note the classic Rayleigh limit \(\frac{0.61\lambda}{NA}\) predicts ~230nm resolution using this filter cube, which even unmodified microscopes rarely achieve in our experience.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Volumetric imaging capability of remote refocus illustrated via 3D structures on the Argolight SIM slide.</strong> The pattern consists of a 3D array of 9x9x9 rings separated by 5 &mu;m in X, Y, and Z. We acquired the data by focusing the microscope Z-drive onto the top plane, and then used the RR piezo to take the Z-stack. The stack was then processed with ImageJ to give 3D projections from various angles (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">acquisition</a> section for details).</figcaption>

<h4>Much faster than standard focusing, especially with non-rigid and delicate samples</h4>

<p>Having established excellent image quality, we next measured the speed of our remote refocus (Figure 8) using a series of standard samples: a glass slide with chrome graticule (very rigid), a glass slide with agarose pad and coverslip (semi-rigid), a plastic dish with coverslip bottom (semi-flexible) and a microfluidic chip (very flexible). We compare our RR's focusing speed vs. standard focusing methods: the motorized primary objective of a premium microscope stand, and a high-performance Z-piezo stage insert. For each sample, we set the microscope stand primary objective to an initial 10 &mu;m de-focus, and used each device in turn to focus the sample and then return to its initial position. The allotted focusing times for the RR piezo (15 ms) and the piezo stage insert (50 ms) were determined by their <a href="./appendix.html#Figure_A4">measured</a> 10 &mu;m step-and-settle times (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">acquisition</a> section for details). The focusing time of the motorized objective (~100 ms) is bottlenecked by serial port communication latency. Note that serial port communication is the primary bottleneck for most microscopy systems; we encourage anyone interested in fast acquisition to gain a thorough understanding of their hardware control dynamics and <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGYork/tools/blob/master/ni.py">learn how to use an analog-out card</a> TODO: a more pedagogical link?.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 8: RR delivers faster focusing and less sample disturbance vs. standard techniques, for a range of standard samples.</strong> 

Each column of the figure shows one sample type. The top panel is a photo of the sample, showing how it was mounted. The middle panel shows a 1000 fps video of focusing performance for a 10 &mu;m motion of the microscope stand (first motion), the piezo stage insert (second motion), and the RR (third motion) for that sample. The bottom panel shows a kymograph of image intensity vs. space (left/right) and time (up/down) of a central horizontal line of pixels from the corresponding video. The video illustrates the lateral sample disturbance due to each method, and the kymograph highlights the axial focusing speed. Note that the figure is interactive, allowing the reader to switch between displaying either: <strong>(1)</strong> a very rigid graticule (left) and a very flexible microfluidic chip (right), or <strong>(2)</strong> a somewhat rigid coverslip/agarose pad/glass slide sample (left, like the one shown in Figure 1) and a somewhat flexible plastic dish with bonded 170 &mu;m coverglass and a sprinkling of aluminum particles for imaging contrast (right).

<!--

This text should probably be in the body rather than the caption, and I don't want to delete it until I'm sure:

The figure is interactive and consists of 4 sub figures that are paired: (graticule + microfluidic chip) and (agarose pad + dish), where each sub figure consists of 3 panels: a video of focusing at 1000fps (top), intensity vs time for a slice of the video (middle) and a photo of the sample (bottom).  The microfluidic chip consists of a finely featured PDMS device bonded to standard 170&mu;m coverglass and was designed and tested for high resolution microscopy of live biology in 4D. Here the microscope and stage insert are unable to focus on the sample at high speed due to the coupling of the oil which causes the sample to flex, where as the remote re-focus can operate unimpeded and shows huge (27x) gains in speed. The agarose slide consists of a standard glass slide with a ~1mm agarose pad and <em>C. elegans</em> under a standard 170&mu;m coverslip. The relatively slow microscope stand was able to focus on the worm in a similar way to the graticule (some xy motion) but because the agarose is not fully rigid the faster stage insert could not reach a sharp focus in the time interval (the remote re-focus was unimpeded). The dish sample consists of a premium manufactured plastic dish with bonded 170&mu;m converglass and a sprinkling of aluminium particles for imaging. This sample was more flexible than the agarose pad and so the microscope and stage insert struggled to find sharp focus and predictably the remote re-focus was unaffected.
-->
</figcaption></figure>
<p></p>

<p>The graticule is an opaque chrome mask deposited on a small, thick glass slide, supported by a larger solid metal slide. This stiff, well-clamped sample is nearly undisturbed by the immersion oil during fast focusing via the piezo stage insert (50 ms), and it may not be obvious what advantage RR offers in this regime. However, the RR is still &gt;3x faster (15 ms), because RR lets us use a powerful, bulky piezo, <a href="./appendix.html#Figure_A4">tuned to drive a fixed mass</a>. This large tuned piezo is ill-suited for conventional focusing: it doesn't fit typical microscope nosepieces, its power cable antagonizes objective turret rotation, and it would need retuning every time the sample or primary objective changed for maximum peformance.</p>

<p>The advantages of RR increase for less rigid samples, which are more typical in our experience. For example, the agarose sample sandwiches <em>C. elegans</em> on a ~1 mm agarose pad between a standard glass slide and a 170 &mu;m coverslip, or the dish sample, a standard manufactured plastic dish with bonded 170 &mu;m coverglass and a sprinkling of aluminium particles for imaging contrast. The flexibility of the agarose prevents the piezo stage insert from reaching sharp focus in the alloted time, and even more so for the dish. Predictably, the remote refocus was unaffected by the flexibility or mass of either sample.</p>

<p>The microfluidic chip is a finely featured polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) device bonded to a 60x50 mm<sup>2</sup> 100 &mu;m coverglass, designed for long-term high resolution 3D microscopy of living yeast. The sample is inherently flexible, and moving the microscope objective or stage insert bends it substantially via the immersion oil, requiring more than 400 ms settling time. Of course the delicate nature of this sample is irrelevant to the RR, which gives an impressive 27x speed advantage in this case. This eliminates a common tension between microscope builders and microscope users; it's easy for the builder to criticize the sample for being too flexible, but redesigning a complex microfluidic chip as presented here or (more generally) any delicate biological sample should not be taken lightly. Our colleagues are delighted that the remote refocus saves them from choosing between slow image acquisition or laborious chip redesign, and we suspect many others would have the same experience.</p>

<h4>Dynamic 4D biology</h4>

<p>Having established excellent optical and mechanical performance, we next explore the ability and the limits of remote refocus for imaging living organisms at high speed. Samples include <em>C. elegans</em> roaming an agarose pad imaged at up to 20 volumes/s (Figure 1), yeast cells flowing in microfluidic channels imaged at up to 50 volumes/s (Figures 2 and 9), and waterborne protozoa freely moving in a 3D volume imaged at up to 14 volumes/s (Figure 9).</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 9: Demonstrations of 4D biological imaging via RR.</strong> Yeast 3 color: imaged with transmitted light, GFP and RFP flowing in a 150 &mu;m wide microfluidic channel with a depth of 10&mu;m, 12 slices in 0.5 &mu;m steps with 6ms exposure times giving 4.6 volumes/s. Yeast 2 color: imaged with transmitted light and GFP flowing in a 150 &mu;m wide microfluidic channel with a depth of 10 &mu;m, 12 slices in 1 &mu;m steps with 10 ms exposure times giving 4.2 volumes/s. Amoeba: imaged with DIC in a 184 well plate with 170 &mu;m coverglass, 4 slices in 5 &mu;m steps with 20 ms exposure times giving 12.5 volumes/s. Paramecium, spirostomum, spirostomum "food" and spirostomum "flower": all imaged with DIC in a 184 well plate with 170 &mu;m coverglass, 6 slices in 10 &mu;m steps with 10 ms exposure times giving 16.7 volumes/s. The field of view varies between samples (see original data in the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">acquisition</a> section) but the scale bar is 20 &mu;m in all cases.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>The adjustable field of view on the RR is one of the main advantages of the system as it allows the user to run the camera at the maximum data rate whilst tuning the region of interest to match the sample. This enables higher frame rates compared to full chip acquisition and for the right sample can ensure that only useful pixels are collected. However it should be noted that only cropping on 1 axis will increase the frames per second whilst maintaining maximum pixels per second and this gives an elongated field of view which is not suitable for all specimens. We also stress that high frame rates produce an elongated depth of field if the step and settle time of the piezo (~10ms here) exceeds the readout time of the camera (10ms full chip here).</p>

<p>For example in Figure 2 we achieved a 2ms exposure time by cropping the camera 10 fold on the up-down axis to reach a 1ms rolling time with 1ms of illumintation (500fps). We then ran the RR piezo to give a triangular wave motion with a 15&mu;m amplitude and a 20ms period resulting in a 1.5&mu;m/ms constant velocity mode during the bi-directional acquisition. For 1ms of illumination this results in an effective 1.5&mu;m extension to the depth of field which is ~2 fold the static depth of field if we estimate with \(\frac{2\lambda n}{NA^2}\) (~750nm). This is an extreme example of a high speed acquisition where this consideration is important, however we expect most users will operate close to full chip acquisition and with longer exposures (due to dim samples) where the elongated depth of field considerations are not relevant.</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>Remote re-focus gives the highest spatiotemporal resolution in many applications</h4>

<p>Many applications of high resolution optical microscopy of live organisms could benefit from a decoupling of the focusing mechanism from the sample space by using the remote re-focus method, which is particularly relevant when sensitive or flexible mounting of the sample is inherent and fast 4D acquisitions are required.</p>

<p>
TODO: Additional Discussion outline:

* Modular unit. Solves one problem, doesn't make other problems. Can combine with spinning disk, light-sheet, SIM, etc.
* Does NOT deliver truly simultaneous images; when you need a true 3D "snapshot", use multifocus or light-field.
* Cost: more expensive than light-field
* Ripe for commercial adoption; to our knowledge, Tony Wilson's patent is not yet licensed.
* We're interested in integrating with Micromanager. Contact us if you are too.
* We use python control code. Contact us if you want help doing the same.
* We're very eager to see others adopt the technique; contact us if you're building one and want to discuss.

<!--
This stuff is more of a summary than a discussion; probably delete, but I'll leave it here for now just in case.
<p> Here we clearly outline the concept, method and rules for those wishing to design and build their own RR system and provide a brief overview of the history of the technique.</p>

<p>A high performance RR arrangement is presented that may be easily replicated with a detailed discussion of the associated design choices and alignment procedure. The system is shown to have excellent optical properties over a huge 200x200x60&mu;m volume with good corresponding mechanical stability and fast motion dynamics that result in a maximally performant photon limited system when using a modern sCMOS camera at full field. The benefits of RR are demonstrated using typical samples where it clearly outperforms standard focusing methods with speed gains in the 3-27x range. The imaging capabilities of the system are then shown through a series of live biological samples with speeds ranging from 2.5-50 volumes/s.</p>
