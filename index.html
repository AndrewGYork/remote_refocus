<h3>Abstract</h3>
<p class="abstract"> High resolution in space and time is often essential for studying life under a microscope. Fast 2D microscopy has been routine for decades (limited by signal levels or detector speed), but 3D is much slower, typically limited by the focusing method. Here we show that remote refocus

removes focusing as a speed limit while adding minimal drawbacks, and we propose that remote refocus is the right technique for most high-speed 3D microscopy applications. To our knowledge, there is no commercial implementation of remote refocus, so we provide a modular high-performance design to enable others to build their own. We also present the concept, method and rules of remote refocus to help others improve or modify our design. Our design gives camera-limited speed (&gt;4.2x10<sup>8</sup> voxels/s) and  diffraction-limited resolution (&lt;270 nm) over a user-specified volume up to 200x200x60 &mu;m<sup>3</sup>. We demonstrate the speed and flexibility of remote refocus using a variety of live biological samples with 3D rates ranging from 2.5-50 volumes per second, 3-27x faster than standard focusing methods.</p>

<h3>Intended audience</h3>
<p class="abstract">Microscopy users, developers, engineers and scientists interested in fast volumetric imaging at high resolution. We tried to write the article in an accessible and straighforward fashion; our aim is to lower the barrier to making a good remote refocus, and allow readers to easily replicate our design, or design and build their own with confidence.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<h4>Remote refocus removes the primary speed limit of 3D microscopy, with minimal drawbacks</h4>

<p>Revealing the 3D dynamics of living samples is the greatest strength of optical microscopy. To capture these dynamics, we assemble 4D spatiotemporal information from a series of 3D spatial measurements, which are in turn assembled from a series of 2D images

2D imaging at "video rate" or above (20-30 frames per second) has been standard in the field for decades

<p>Light flux from the sample sets a fundamental limit on temporal resolution; even a detector with infinite speed and zero noise must wait until it detects enough photoelectrons to form a decent image

Photoelectron-limited operation is rarely achieved due to hardware limitations, which in 2D imaging is often the camera speed (pixels per second and frames per second) and in 3D imaging is typically the axial (Z) focusing mechanism.</p>

<p>In our hands, RR eliminates the 3D bottleneck, pushing axial focusing speed beyond camera-limited speed (or photoelectron-limited speed, for dim samples). Remote refocusing's drawbacks are minimal: lower optical efficiency due to four extra lenses in the emission path, and an extended depth of field at the highest volumetric frame rates. Whilst lower efficiency is never desirable, we note that additional lenses in the emission path are tolerable and typical in many microscopy setups, such as external filter wheels, spinning disk units, etc. Elongated depth of field is either a blessing or a curse depending on the application, but only becomes relevant at the highest volumetric rates, when RR piezo settling times exceed the rolling time of our camera (see <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section for details).<p>

push axial focusing speed to infinity, but reduce camera-limited imaging speed. Multifocus microscopy's X, Y, and Z fields of view can't be adjusted, which wastes voxels per second unless the sample happens to perfectly fill the (fixed) imaging volume. Light field microscopy yields even fewer voxels per second than multifocus microscopy, because it measures multiple camera pixels to characterize one Nyquist-limited voxel (other drawbacks include worse resolution and mandatory post-processing). These techniques are therefore faster than RR when the bottleneck is focusing time, but slower when the bottleneck is the camera. In our experience with well-engineered fluorescence microscopes, the bottleneck is always the camera. Multifocal and light field microscopy also combine awkwardly with powerful 3D techniques like light-sheet or spinning-disk microscopy, which combine elegantly with remote refocus [TODO: MAYBE TWO CITATIONS HERE?].
</p>

<p>Given the importance of fast 3D imaging, and the power and flexibility of RR, we're surprised RR isn't more popular. The <a href="./appendix.html#History">history</a> of RR shows many clever technical innovations, but few biological applications, and no commercial implementations. We speculate RR suffers from two problems: surprising pitfalls during design and construction, and a lack of advertising. We hope our design empowers builders to painlessly, confidently make their own RR, and we hope data like Figure 1 (high-resolution 3D images of <em>C. elegans</em> at 20 volumes per second) and Figure 2 (high-resolution 3D images of yeast flowing in a microfluidic channel at 50 volumes per second) will entice microscope users to try RR for their high-speed imaging challenges. Most of all, we hope to inspire microscope manufacturers to commercialize and disseminate remote refocus as the "gold standard" solution for fast 3D imaging problems.</p>

<h4>The why and how of remote re-focus</h4>

<p></p>
<p>The motivation for fast re-focusing to give volumetric information is clear but the advantages of ‘remote’ or indeed what this means may not be obvious. In standard microscopes focusing is achieved with the familiar z-axis motion of either the primary objective or the sample to select the image plane (Figure 3, a) ). This is conveniently simple but the relatively high inertia of these elements on a typical microscope stand presents a major drawback when agile motion is required. This can be overcome by integrating a high power z-drive actuator onto the objective whilst holding the sample stationary to avoid disturbance, but when the highest resolutions are needed an immersion medium is used which gives an unwanted mechanical coupling. This is particularly detrimental when working with sensitive samples or in a dipping regime where fast movements of the objective will often give blur or wobble artefacts (Figure 3, c) ).</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 3: Schematics of normal focusing vs remote re-focus at moderate and high acquisition speeds.</strong> a) Typical focusing where the primary objective is moved with respect to the sample to change the focal plane. In high resolution imaging the immersion medium creates an unwanted mechanical coupling which is only acceptable at moderate speeds. b) A schematic of remote re-focus where the primary objective and sample are stationary during focusing which removes the mechanical coupling. c) Normal focusing at high speeds with immersion medium can disturb the sample and prevent 3D imaging. d) Remote re-focus can produce fast 4D acquisitions because the sample is isolated from focus related motion.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p></p>
<p>The ability to re-focus remotely, without moving either the sample or the primary objective (Figure 3, b) ), can completely isolate the sample from perturbations and present unique opportunities to improve motion dynamics to give significantly faster 4D acquisitions (Figure 3, d) ). Additional benefits include the 'bolt on' nature of the module which does not interfere with the normal operation of the microscope and provides a convenient space for a fast filter wheel without the need for an additional telescope which is commonly added for this purpose.</p>

<p>A detailed description of RR theory is elegantly presented in the original paper 
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007" title="An optical technique for remote focusing in microscopy; E.J. Botcherby, R. Jusˇkaitis, M.J. Booth and T. Wilson; Optics Communications, vol 281(4), p880-887, (2007)">Botcherby 2007</a>]
and will not be re-visited here. We do however provide a straightforward
<a href="./appendix.html#Concept, rules and simulation">concept, rules and simulation</a>

<a href="./appendix.html">appendix</a>
for those looking to build their own RR which highlights the potential pitfalls. We also give a concise summary of the

of the technique which may help the reader frame its use in the field of microscopy and understand how the RR version presented here fits into the story.</p>

<h3>Results</h3>
<h4>Large diffraction limited volumes</h4>

<p>The remote re-focus system presented in this article is designed to couple to a typical microscope stand and produce diffraction limited images using a 60x1.45 oil immersion objective (Figure 4). The z-drive included can achieve step and settle times in the 0.1-1&mu;m range in &lt;10 ms which is faster than the rolling time of a good sCMOS camera at full field, and so the dynamics of the system are purely photon and detector limited in this regime. A detailed description of the module can be found in the <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> and <a href="./appendix.html#Build">build</a> sections of the <a href="./appendix.html">appendix</a> and so here the emphasis will be on the resulting optical performance.</p>

 and the thorough optical design work implemented here meant that traditional and labour intensive volumetric PSF characterisation (using beads) was avoided and substituted for the very convenient <a href="http://argolight.com/">Argolight</a> SIM slide. This sample does not have subdriffactive point sources but does feature spatially stable patterns with broadband excitation/emmision bands and non bleaching linear features down to 30nm seperation. This was considered more than sufficient for evaluating the resolution and field of view of the RR and so the optical performance data is presented on this basis.</p>

Here the microscope z-drive was used to de-focus the sample and then the RR piezo was used to re-focus and take pictures and therefore scan the design volume of the instrument (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">aquisition</a> section for details and links to the original data).</p>

<p>Furthermore by translating finely spaced SIM resolution lines througth the field of view we could readily resolve line features to better than 270nm accross the entire volume (Figure 6). Note that this is an upper bound on resolving power with the central volume showing &lt;240 nm. The classic Rayleigh limit \(\frac{0.61\lambda}{NA}\) gives an expectation of ~230nm in the green and so this demonstrates excellent overall optical performance that is consistent with our expections of diffraction limited performance within the design volume (see <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section for details).</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 6: Diffraction limited resolution accross the design volume using finely seperated flourescent lines (Argoligh SIM slide).</strong> The engineered pattern consists of 14 line pairs that range from fully overlapped to a separation of 390nm in 30nm steps. The data shows a 200x200x60 &mu;m volume with resolving power better than 270nm line seperation and better than 240nm resolution in the central volume. To acquire the data the microscope z-drive was used to de-focus the sample and then the RR piezo was used to re-focus and take pictures and therefore scan the design volume of the instrument. The figure is interative and allows the user to navigate the data set and inspect the image quality.</figcaption>

<p>To complete the testing straightforward broadband optical efficiency and stability tests were carried out giving a throughput of &gt;73% and a mechanical drift of ~150nm/h respectively (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Design">design</a> section).

<figcaption><strong>Figure 7: Volumetric imaging capability of remote re-focus shown with a 3D structure (Argolight SIM slide).</strong> The pattern consists of a 3D array of 9x9x9 rings separated by 5&mu;m on each orthogal axis. The data was acquired by focusing the microscope z-drive onto the top plane and then using the RR piezo to take the z stack. The stack was then processed with ImageJ to give a 3D projection using default parameters, the original stack and processing method is available in the data repository (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">aquisition</a> section for details).</figcaption>
</figure>

<h4>Much faster, especially with non-rigid and delicate samples</h4>

<p>Having established excellent optical performance, the temporal dynamics of the remote re-focus were explored using a series of standard samples: a glass slide with chrome graticule (rigid), a glass slide with agarose pad and coverslip (semi-rigid), a plastic dish with coverslip bottom (semi-rigid) and a microfluidic chip (flexible) (Figure 8). To evaluate the advantages of the RR the system was compared to a typcal microscope stand and a high peformance piezo stage insert. For each sample the microsope was used to set an initial 10 &mu;m de-focus and then each device in turn was used to focus the sample with an approprate time interval before returning to it's initial position. The allocated time was determined in a sample independent way, either by the resulting serial communications latency for the microscope (&gt; 100ms) or by evaluating the step and settle time of the piezo devices (15-50ms) using internal sensors (see the <a href="./appendix.html#Acquisition">aquisition</a> section in the <a href="./appendix.html">appendix</a> for details).</p>

<p>For the graticule and agarose slides all three z-drives were able to reach focus in the allocated times, with the microscope showing significant xy motion but the piezo stage insert and RR options both focusing as expected. Because these samples are stiff and well clamped the main benefit of the RR in this regime is the physical decoupling of the fast z-drive from the microscope which allows a wide range of actuators to be considered. In this design the &lt;15 ms step and settle of the RR (10&mu;m jump) is achieved by using a bulky piezo unit that does not fit on every microscope platform and occupies a large space that interferes with the nosepiece automation and neighbouring objectives. Because the RR piezo unit is large, powerful and specifically optimised for the RR objective it offers an immediate 3x gain in speed compared to the other methods we tested, regardless of the sample. It should also be noted that another major practical benefit of this architecture is that the RR piezo, camera and light source can all be triggered and controlled by high speed analogue signals which aviods the communication latency that often cripples good temporal performance in focusing.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure 8: Focusing response of standard samples comparing a microscope stand, piezo stage insert and remote re-focus.</strong> The figure is interactive and consists of 4 sub figures that are paired: (graticule + microfluidc chip) and (agarose pad + dish), where each sub figure consists of 3 panels: a video of focusing at 1000fps (top), intensity vs time for a slice of the video (middle) and a photo of the sample (bottom). The (very rigid) graticule consists of a thick glass slide with an opaque chrome mask and shows minimal disturbance from the oil coupled focusing motion of the microsope stand and stage insert, where both devices reach focus in the allocated times of 110ms and 50ms respectively. Some xy motion is noticeable from the microscope stand, which is also slow due to serial communication latency, but the stage insert performs well and so the (3x) speed advantage of the remote re-focus in this case is purely due to it being more specifically optimised for the task (15ms focus time). The microfluidic chip consists of a finely featured PDMS device bonded to standard 170&mu;m coverglass and was designed and tested for high resolution microscopy of live biology in 4D. Here the microscope and stage insert are unable to focus on the sample at high speed due to the coupling of the oil which causes the sample to flex, where as the remote re-focus can operate unimpeded and shows huge (27x) gains in speed. The agarose slide consists of a standard glass slide with a ~1mm agarose pad and C. Elegans under a standard 170&mu;m coverslip. The relatively slow microscope stand was able to focus on the worm in a similar way to the graticule (some xy motion) but because the agarose is not fully rigid the faster stage insert could not reach a sharp focus in the time interval (the remote re-focus was unimpeded). The dish sample consists of a premium manufactured plastic dish with bonded 170&mu;m converglass and a sprinkling of aluminium particles for imaging. This sample was more flexible than the agarose pad and so the microscope and stage insert struggled to find sharp focus and predictably the remote re-focus was unaffected.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p></p>
<p>For the dish and microfluidic chip samples the advantages of the RR are substantial. The microscope is able to reach focus on the dish by virture of being ~7x slower, which gives the oil and sample just enough time to settle (although the xy motion is still noticable). The stage insert however is only ~3x slower and so extra settle time must be added to the acquisition to compensate for the motion coupled to the sample and reach a sharp focus. With the flexible microfluidic chip the coupling of the oil is more detrimental and incapacitates both the microscope and stage inserts ability to focus on the normal time scales (50-110ms). In a separate test the settle time was found to be ~400ms which is ~27x slower than the RR. The RR naturally performs as well with the dish and microfluidc chip as with any other sample giving a speed advantage in the 3-27x range for the samples demonstrated here and larger benefits expected in a water dipping regime where this technique could revolutionise z stack acquisition.</p>

<h4>Dynamic 4D biology</h4>

<p>Having established both excellent optomechanical performance of the remote re-focus and clear speed advantages of using it with a range of standard samples some readily available living organisms were identified and imaged. Here we show the RR in action with waterborne Protozoa freely moving in a 3D volume at up to 14 volumes/s (Figure 9), C. elegans freely roaming around on an agarose pad at up to 20 volumes/s (Figure 1) and yeast cells flowing in microfluidic channels at up to 50 volumes/s (Figures 2 and 9).</p>

<h3>Discussion</h3>
<h4>Remote re-focus gives the highest spatiotemporal resolution in many applications</h4>

TODO: Andy editorial
<p></p>
<p>Many applications of high resolution optical microscopy of live organisms could benefit from a decoupling of the focusing mechanism from the sample space by using the remote re-focus method, which is particularly relevant when sensitive or flexible mounting of the sample is inherent and fast 4D acquisitions are required. Here we clearly outline the concept, method and rules for those wishing to design and build their own RR system and provide a brief overview of the history of the technique.</p>

<p>A high performance RR arrangement is presented that may be easily replicated with a detailed discussion of the associated design choices and alignment procedure. The system is shown to have excellent optical properties over a huge 200x200x60&mu;m volume with good corresponding mechanical stability and fast motion dynamics that result in a maximally performant photon limited system when using a modern sCMOS camera at full field. The benefits of RR are demonstrated using typical samples where it clearly outperforms standard focusing methods with speed gains in the 3-27x range. The imaging capabilities of the system are then shown through a series of live biological samples with speeds ranging from 2.5-50 volumes/s.</p>
