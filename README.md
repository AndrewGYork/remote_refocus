Abstract

Remote re-focusing is shown to be a powerful technique for high speed volumetric imageing with sensitive samples. The concept, method and rules of remote-refocus are presented and a high performance arrangement is provided with diffraction limited performance over a 200x200x60Âµm volume and motion dynamics that give a photon limited system when using a modern sCMOS camera at full field. The benefits of the instrument are demonstrated using typical samples with speed gains in the 3-27x range over standard methods and the imaging capabilities are shown through a series of live biological samples with speeds ranging from 2.5-50 volumes/s.

Intended audience

Microscopy users, developers, engineers and scientists interested in fast volumetric imaging at high resolution. A method, recipe and evaluation of 'remote re-focus' (RR) is provided with the aim of lowering the barrier to making a good device. The article is written in an accessible and straighforward fashion to allow readers to easily replicate the implemented system, or design and build their own with confidence.
