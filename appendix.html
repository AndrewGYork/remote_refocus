<h2>Remote refocus enables class-leading spatiotemporal resolution in 4D optical microscopy</h2>

Concept, rules and simulation</h3>
<h4>The idea</h4>

<p>The basic concept of remote refocus is to make a 3D unity-magnification copy of the sample volume at a remote location, and then image this with a second microscope. Under normal operation, collecting light with a microscope objective away from the corrected focal plane will introduce aberrations that depend strongly on the effective de-focus and give unacceptably poor 3D image quality

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-45524-2" title="Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy, third edition; J. Pawley; Springer US, ISBN 978-0-387-25921-5, eBook ISBN 978-0-387-45524-2, (2006)">Pawley 2006</a>].

The 'magic' of RR is to use a standard microscope setup (objective/tube lens) in combination with a reversed copy of the optics (tube lens/objective) to produce an abberation-free 3D image - where the second microscope is configured to cancel the aberrations of the first. The detailed optical theory of RR is elegantly described in the original paper

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007" title="An optical technique for remote focusing in microscopy; E.J. Botcherby, R. Juškaitis, M.J. Booth and T. Wilson; Optics Communications, vol 281(4), p880-887, (2007)">Botcherby 2007</a>]

and will not be re-visited here. However, for those wishing to build an RR system, there are a few simple concepts and rules that should be highlighted.</p>

<p>Firstly there are two main optical arrangements (Figure A1) which we'll refer to as single objective remote refocus (SORR) and double objective remote refocus (DORR) for ease of discussion. DORR is the most straightforward implementation, and in its most elementary form consists of 3 identical microscopes back to back, where moving either the 2nd or 3rd objective will perform the refocusing. The simplest version of the SORR variant uses a single objective in a double pass configuration with an additional beam splitter optic and mirror. The re-focus in SORR is then performed by moving either the objective or the mirror.</p>

<figure id="Figure_A1">
<img src="images/RR_schematic/RR_schematic.png" alt="Figure A1" id="Figure_A1_svg" style="width:100%;">
<figcaption><strong>Figure A1: A schematic of the two basic remote refocus arrangements.</strong> Double objective remote refocus (DORR) vs. single objective remote refocus (SORR).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>The main benefit of SORR is that the mirror can be very small and agile (&lt;1 mm diameter) as it only has to cover the original sample scaled field of view (FOV), but the penalty is the introduction of the beam splitter optic. If a SORR is used with polarized light then the introduction of a quarter wave plate and polarizing beam splitter cube can give high optical efficiency. However in most imaging modalities light is unpolarized and so the splitter optic in the SORR arrangement results in an immediate signal loss of 50% with a polarizing splitter and quarter wave plate, or 75% with a 50/50 splitter. Despite this loss the SORR arrangement has been implemented in many microscopes due to the potentially high speeds and the relative simplicity of the optical train as discussed in the <a href="./appendix.html#History" target="_self">history</a> section. However if maximum efficiency is prioritized then the DORR arrangement is preferable and inherently faster in 'photon limited' applications, and for this reason the DORR arrangement was pursued in this work.
</p>

<h4>The golden rules</h4>

<p>Secondly there are a number of <strong>‘golden rules’</strong> for remote re-focus which must be respected to achieve best performance and are independent of the SORR or DORR arrangement.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The <strong>magnification</strong> between the sample and its remote 3D copy should be set <strong>equal to the ratio of the index</strong> between these two locations:

	\[M_{RR} = \frac{n_{sample}}{n_{RR}}\]

For an air based RR system with \(n_{RR}=1\) then this gives \(M_{RR}\approx1.5\) for oil and \(M_{RR}\approx1.33\) for water, etc.</li>

  <li>The optics downstream of the first objective should have <strong>enough clear aperture</strong> (CA) to accommodate the full wavefront as vignetting by any optic (tube lens or mirror etc.) will reduce resolution. It should be noted that the operation of RR expands the CA requirement beyond the normal range of a microscope, as defocused positions create non-infinity rays that may not be accommodated by the usual optical train. In this regard another critical consideration is that the RR objectives must have an angular acceptance that is greater than or equal to the first objective:

	\[\frac{\text{NA}_{RR}}{n_{RR}} \geq \frac{\text{NA}_{sample}}{n_{sample}}\]

Again for an air based RR system with \(n_{RR}=1\) then this simplifies to:

	\[\text{NA}_{RR} \geq \frac{\text{NA}_{sample}}{n_{sample}}\]</li>

  <li>The <strong>individual objectives and tube lenses</strong> in the first two image relays which produce the 3D copy of the sample <strong>should approximate ideal lenses</strong>. RR theory is valid for lenses that well approximate ideal thin lenses placed in a 4f configuration, and deviating from this can have drastic effects on RR performance. It should be noted that not all objectives and tube lenses operate in this mode and so builders should choose their optics carefully. If you don't have detailed design information from your objective's manufacturer, we recommend you use the design we present here.</li>
  <li>The tube lenses between the first and second objective in the system should be in a <strong>telecentric 4f arrangement</strong> to give <strong>best performance</strong>. On a typical commercial microscope stand this is often not the case, as the distance between the objective and tubes lens can be less than one focal length for practical reasons. This does not affect performance during normal use, but can degrade RR operation.</li>
</ol>

<h4>How to check</h4>

<p>It should be noted that the aforementioned rules for remote refocus place substantial constraints on the optical design, and if followed carefully a well performing system can be built with relative ease, without the need for detailed optical design information or simulation. On the other hand, it can be difficult to know if a given objective is sufficiently "ideal". For those with access to detailed information about their optics and a suitable simulation software package like <a href="http://www.zemax.com/">Zemax</a> we recommend evaluating the performance of a possible RR configuration before building (Figure A2). Even for a novice designer this process can be relatively straightforward with the following workflow:</p>

<ul>
<li>Start by laying out a simple DORR optical train with ideal elements that match the diameters and focal lengths of the intended build and adhere to the <strong>‘golden rules’</strong> of RR.</li>
<li>Defocus the sample and chase the image with one of the RR objectives by the magnification factor between the conjugate planes (1st golden rule). The RR should work perfectly and any basic mistakes in design will be highlighted at this point and can be easily corrected.</li>
<li>Now substitute in real components and evaluate the performance of the RR over its axial range. All of the non-idealities of the system will now show to give a finite range over which the real system can be expected to be diffraction limited (DL) if built and aligned correctly.</li>
</ul>

Design</h3>

<h4>A high performance remote refocus for a 60x oil objective</h4>

<p>In this section a recipe for a high performance remote refocus in the DORR configuration is given and presented as a versatile addition to a typical microscope stand. This RR module is designed to work with a high NA 60x oil immersion objective and is capable of producing multicolor DL stacks over the full FOV of a standard sCMOS camera. The emphasis in this design was on achieving a high performance RR using minimal custom parts. In this vein, all of the optics and the majority of the mechanics are relatively low cost, short lead time stock parts, with only a few simple bespoke mechanics where needed. The merits and choices of the design will now be discussed in turn and the reader may refer to the <a href="./appendix.html#Build" target="_self">build</a> section for a full <a href="./appendix.html#Parts" target="_self">list of parts</a>, <a href="./appendix.html#Drawings" target="_self">drawings</a> and an <a href="./appendix.html#Alignment" target="_self">alignment procedure</a>.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure A3: 3D CAD wireframe projection of the remote refocus.</strong> Modeling the mechanics of the remote refocus in CAD is straightforward, highly informative and recommended to potential builders.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p></p>
<p>To avoid custom optics, this DORR is based on the readily available <a href="https://www.nikoninstruments.com">Nikon</a> 60x 1.4 NA oil and 40x 0.95 NA air objectives that, together with stock tube lenses, <strong>very conveniently obey</strong> the first three <strong>golden rules</strong> of RR, with the 4th rule achieved by setting the right mechanical spacing of the elements (see <a href="./appendix.html#Drawings" target="_self">drawings</a>). By working closely with <a href="https://www.nikoninstruments.com">Nikon</a>, we were able to establish excellent performance with a 450-650 nm polychromatic Strehl ratio &gt;0.74 over an axial range of +/-32 &mu;m in the sample with a 150 &mu;m diameter field of view.</p>

<p>With good optical design established, the choice of Z-drive actuator was made relatively straightforward - an axial range of +/-32 &mu;m in the sample with an index of ~1.5 corresponds to motion in air of ~+/-50 &mu;m, which sits comfortably in the range of high performance piezo actuators - like the heavy duty <a href="https://www.physikinstrumente.com">PI</a> 726 that can move a ~200 g objective at &gt;500 Hz over a 100 &mu;m range. The 726 can achieve step-and-settle times in the 0.1-1 &mu;m range in &lt;10 ms (Figure A3), which is faster than the rolling time of a good sCMOS camera like the <a href="https://www.pco.de/">PCO</a>.edge 4.2 at full field of view. This equates to a running mode of 100 fps, giving 10 volumes per second for a 10-slice stack.<p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure A4: Screen shots of piezo performance.</strong> This figure is interactive and shows the step-and-settle performance of the piezo stage insert and remote refocus piezo for various parameters captured using the manufacturer's software and the built-in sensors on the devices. Note the 'Amplitude [&mu;m]' box and the time (ms) on the x-axis for the blue line plot to settle.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>Cropping the camera chip can produce higher frame rates for the fastest acquisitions, but in this regime the rolling time of the camera can be shorter than the step-and-settle time of the piezo, and motionless frames are no longer straightforward. It is straightforward, however, to operate the piezo in a constant-velocity mode, by sending a triangle wave signal to its analog input with an amplitude that corresponds to the desired stack size. The camera can then take frames at a high rate as the piezo moves continuously through the sample to give fast volumetric imaging but with an extended depth of field. It should also be noted that due to current limitations on sCMOS cameras the increased frame rates are achieved by cropping only one axis (up/down) with no benefit to cropping the second axis (left/right), and this forces elongated fields of view that may not be appropriate for all samples.</p>

<p>This motion solution prioritizes performance above economy, but may be substituted for other devices for those on a budget. Z-drive flexibility is a second-order advantage of using the RR arrangement - large, atypical actuators that would otherwise be awkward to fit to a typical microscope can be accomodated with relative ease and do not interfere with normal operation of the stand.</p>

<p>The RR optics are folded with 4 standard 1" highly reflective mirrors, both to give a more compact footprint and also orientate the RR objectives into the vertical position for mechanical stability. The mirrors are housed in standard 3-axis kinematic mounts for ease of alignment and were noted to be slightly undersized at the design phase. This causes a small amount of vignetting in the corners of the sCMOS FOV at diameters &gt;17.5 mm, but seemed like a good trade rather than upgrading to 2" mirrors and substantially increasing the size and cost of the module for relatively little gain. The fold arrangement accommodates common incubation chambers by keeping the optical train low and long out of the microscope side port, which is desirable for many live cell applications.</p>

<p>Another critical part of the design is the ability to align and stabilize the RR objectives, as unwanted motion here will translate directly into the image, making it the most sensitive part of the module. The Z-drive piezo/objective assembly is therefore mounted on a heavy-duty frame and isolated from the adjustable objective, which is mounted on an X/Y/Z translation stage to give the fine adjustment needed for alignment. Both RR objectives benefit from the gravitationally-aligned, axially symmetric vertical arrangement, which avoids many of the unwanted drifts and motions that can occur in alternative setups. Stability testing showed X/Y drifts in the 150 nm/hour range for the combined sample, stage, microscope and RR which seems acceptable given typical lab thermal drift and the intended sub-minute run time of a typical acquisition. All of the standard short lead-time optomechanics were sourced from <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/">Thorlabs</a> and could be substituted for equivalent parts from existing lab stock.</p>

<p></p>
<p>An AR-coated 1" 340 &mu;m coverslip correction glass window was ordered from <a href="http://www.markoptics.com/">Mark Optics</a> and inserted between the two 40x air objectives to give best performance, as they are optimised to work with 170 &mu;m of glass. An estimate for the optical efficiency of the RR was then calculated at ~70% with (0.9<sup>2</sup>)(0.95<sup>2</sup>)(0.99<sup>4</sup>)(0.99) for the objectives, tube lenses, mirrors and glass window respectively and was subsequently measured at &gt;73% (Figure A6). For those looking to save on cost, the glass window can also be composed of two standard coverslips sandwiched together with some immersion oil, with the penalty of ~5% loss in signal.</p>

<figcaption><strong>Figure A6: Optical efficiency tests show 73.7% transmission.</strong> The panels show broadband transmited light images for the remote refocus port (left) and camera-only port (right) of the microscope. The RR efficiency is then given as the intensity ratio of these images for <strong>(a)</strong> two standard 170 &mu;m coverslips sandwiched with oil between the RR objectives (68.3%), and <strong>(b)</strong> a custom 340 &mu;m AR-coated glass window (73.7%).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p></p>

<p>A flexible slot was reserved in the infinity space behind the last objective for the inclusion of a high speed emission filter wheel like the <a href="http://www.asiimaging.com/">ASI</a> FW-1000, which we chose for its high speed trigger options and &lt;40 ms switching time. This can be mounted on the RR breadboard or directly to the optical table to avoid any unwanted vibrations that can couple from the torque generated by fast wheels. Of course, any filter wheel that physically fits can be used here - including a low-cost manual wheel from <a href="https://www.thorlabs.com/">Thorlabs</a> that will connect directly to the mechanics for starting off. The camera is easily focused by sliding the Z-position of the last mirror and orientated correctly with the built-in rotation mount, and the caged mirror on the input arm can be used to pull out the intermediate image plane without removing the instrument, if needed. The remaining custom parts were prepared by <a href="http://www.zeradevelopment.com/">Zera Development</a>, but can be also readily milled by almost any CNC machine shop; see the <a href="./appendix.html#Drawings" target="_self">drawings</a> section for details. If you're unfamiliar with machine shops, simply send a copy of the drawing we provide to Zera.</p>

<p>This table can be used as a shopping list for the RR described in this article. Item 37 is a low cost manual filter wheel that can be substituted for an automated wheel if needed, and item 49 can be avoided to reduce cost (substite with two coverslips sandwiched together with oil). With some re-design work, items 38-40 can be substituted for a lower cost option although this is not encouraged as it may negate the intended high speed operation of the device.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alignment with extended tool set and full access to components:
    <ol>
      <li>Collimate a small diameter (&lt;1 mm) low power (&lt;1 mW) laser beam over a few meters and axially align the beam with the appropriate microscope thread (usually M25x0.75 or RMS).</li>
      <li>Remove all the lenses from the system (three objective/tube lens pairs) and the camera.</li>
      <li>Fire the laser beam through the microscope from the primary objective thread and out through the side port and through the RR optical train.</li>
      <li>Use pinholes or irises to firstly align the RR to the microscope by adjusting the height of the feet and the relative position on the table (then bolt down).</li>
      <li>Now use pinholes or irises to axially align the rest of the path using the RR tip tilt mirrors. At the end of this step the beam should be centered in X/Y at every point in the system from the primary objective to the camera.</li>
      <li>Now remove the laser, add the camera and fit the lenses as close as possible to their designed positions ready for imaging.</li>
      <li>Image a known sample (like a graticule) with transmitted light and focus with the eye pieces. Now image with the RR camera and (with the piezo powered and in its nominal rest position) use the X/Y/Z mount on the adjustable objective to focus and center the sample.</li>
      <li>Now de-focus with the microscope stand and re-focus with the RR to check function. Minor adjustments to the mirrors and X/Y/Z objective may be needed for good alignment.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>Alignment with limited tools and access
    <ol>
      <li>Image a known transmitted light sample (like a graticule) with the primary objective tube lens pair on the microscope using the eyepieces to centre and focus.</li>
      <li>Remove the RR lenses (two objective tube lens pairs) and the camera.</li>
      <li>Set the white light source to maximum intensity and darken the room so that the beam is visible throughout the system.</li>
      <li>Use pinholes or irises to firstly align the RR to the microscope by adjusting the height of the feet and the relative position on the table (then bolt down). A graticule with a well-chosen scale can have a visible image (crosshairs) that can be used at the magnified image plane to get good alignment.</li>
      <li>Now use pinholes or irises to axially align the rest of the path using the RR tip/tilt mirrors. At the end of this step the beam should be centered in X/Y at every point in the system, from the primary objective to the camera.</li>
      <li>Add the camera to the RR and fit the lenses as close as possible to their designed positions ready for imaging.</li>
      <li>Image with the RR camera and (with the piezo powered and in its nominal rest position) use the X/Y/Z mount on the adjustable objective to focus and center the sample.</li>
      <li>Now de-focus with the microscope stand and refocus with the RR to check function.</li>
      <li>Adjustments to the position of the RR base, mirrors and X/Y/Z objective will likely be needed for good alignment - expect to iterate.</li>

<h4>How we took our f</h4>

<p> With the above mentioned hardware setup we used <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> scripts to issue serial port commands to devices and create voltages to play with the <a href="http://www.ni.com/">National Instruments</a> analog-out card. In practice, data was taken by focusing on the sample with the microscope Z-drive to give the ‘zero’ or reference position. Focus was then adjusted by using either the microscope Z, the piezo Z stage insert, or the remote refocus piezo depending on the mode of operation.</p>

<p>The original data presented in this article is available to <a href="https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1145453">download from Zenodo (17.5 GB, DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.1145453)</a> and can be unziped (27.3 GB) and used with the <a href="./figure_generation">figure generation</a> code to reproduce the figures in the main text.</p>

<h4 id="Example_code">Example code</h4>

<p> Here we annotate a typical example of the script that was used for data collection. The exact script for each data set was not kept, as it amounted only to minor changes in stack amplitude, step size, exposure, etc., or changes in the order of operation or routine depending on the experiment. Base examples of the scripts used for biological imaging and motion performance can be found in the <a href="./data_generation">data generation folder</a>, including the associated dependencies for running the hardware, with the exception of the microscope stand the control of which cannot be made public due to a proprietary API.</p>

<ol>
<li>Necessary python modules are imported, followed by hardware control scripts. The program then checks if it's the 'main' program and if so imports the multiprocessing module needed for image_data_pipeline.py which runs the camera. A sensible level of verbosity is then set using the logger commands.

<pre><code class="language-python"
># Built-in Python modules

    logger = mp.log_to_stderr()
    logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>COM ports are assigned to the hardware with serial control, and analog-out channels are given to the camera, RR and light source:
	
<pre><code class="language-python"
>    ### COM port assignment
    dmi8_com_port = 'COM4'
    rr_piezo_com_port = 'COM6'
    epi_com_port = 'COM10'

    ### Analog out channel settings
    ao_ch = {'camera'    :0,
             'rr_piezo'  :1,
             'spx_uv'    :2,

    ao_ch_name = {}
    for name, index in ao_ch.items():
        ao_ch_name[index]= name
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>The user sets the choice of objective to be either the 40x 0.95 NA air or 60x 1.4 NA oil. The RR instrument was designed to work with both objectives, but the 'z_ratio' which is the amount the RR piezo needs to move in air to give a certain de-focus in the sample, changes according to the 1st golden rule of RR. In practice with the optics used, we found 0.98 to be correct for air and 1.42 for oil when imaging the Argolight slide. This was calibrated by de-focusing a known amount with the microscope and then seeing what piezo offset was needed to refocus.

<pre><code class="language-python"
>    ### Objective choice
    objective = 'oil' # Choose 'air' or 'oil'
    #  'air':0.98 for best correction collar setting of 0.19 for Argolight
    #  'oil':1.42
    z_ratio = {'air':0.98, 'oil':1.42}[objective]
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>Acquisition parameters are chosen including stack amplitude, step size, number of colors, number of volumes to image, exposure time and file name format. Sensible bounds of memory buffer size and camera chip region-of-interest are asserted to avoid crashes.

<pre><code class="language-python"
>    ### Stack parameters
    stk_amp = 5 # set half amplitude of stack around current focus (um)
    stk_step_size = 1 # set stack step size (um)
    stk_num_steps = round(2 * stk_amp / stk_step_size) + 1
    # RR stack conversion
    rr_stk_amp = stk_amp * z_ratio

    ### Volumetric image information
    num_vol = 2
    num_colors = 2 # To change from 2 must edit voltage code
    num_frames = stk_num_steps * num_vol * num_colors
    assert num_frames &lt; 1001 # Set sensible upper bound on buffer

    ### Illumination settings
    tl_ao_ch = ao_ch['spx_green'] # take an epi channels for trans light
    led_ao_ch = ao_ch['spx_cyan'] # set epi excitation color
    led_intensities = {'uv':255, # set epi excitation intensities
                       'blue':255,
                       'cyan':255,
                       'teal':255,

                       'red':255,}

    ### Camera settings
    exposure_ms = 20 # set exposure - includes rolling time (ms)
    filename_format = '%s_%s_vol_%sum_stk_%sum_step_%sms_exp.tif'
                    # (led_ao_ch, num_vol, stk_amp, stk_step_size, exp_ms)

##                        'left':1,

                        })
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>The camera, analog-out card, microscope, LED light source and RR piezo are initialized. The camera is controlled through the <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGYork/tools/blob/master/image_data_pipeline.py"><code>image_data_pipeline.py</code></a> module which simultaneously handles grabbing frames, displaying to screen and saving to disk using multiprocessing. The data rate for the analog-out card is set at least 10x higher than the fastest acquisition event to ensure synchronization, and the microscope tube lens turret is moved to an empty position so as to not obscure the remote refocus optics. The RR piezo is centered on its reference position and a 'position to voltage' function is defined for analog control:

<li>A voltages vs. time array is created for each channel of the analog-out card for device control (the default is zero volts for channels that are not specified). The exposure time set in the acquisition section is split into camera rolling time (time needed for camera to initialize all pixels) and actual exposure time (time when the LED can be on and data can be taken) with an additional 'jitter time' added to ensure the camera doesn't miss the next trigger after an exposure. With the timeline established, 'lights on' time windows and piezo movements can be given according to the acquisition parameters.

<h4>A summary of RR publications</h4>

<p>Since the original RR paper

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.optcom.2007.10.007" title="An optical technique for remote focusing in microscopy; E.J. Botcherby, R. Juškaitis, M.J. Booth and T. Wilson; Optics Communications, vol 281(4), p880-887, (2007)">Botcherby 2007</a>],

there have been many publications that have used this technique for a variety of applications. The aim of this section is provide a very concise summary of these developments, to help the reader frame the use of RR within the field of microscopy.</p>

<p>
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.16.021843" title="Real-time extended depth of field microscopy; E.J. Botcherby, M.J. Booth, R. Juškaitis and T. Wilson; Optics Express, vol 16(26), p21843-21848, (2008)">Botcherby 2008</a>]

applied a SORR to a spinning disk confocal microscope operating in an extended depth of field (EDF) mode to give Z-projections onto a single camera exposure. This had the advantage of achieving high frame rates due to a small scanning mirror, at the expense of ~50% of the fluorescence light, which is currently the main drawback of the SORR arrangement. A tilt mirror close to the back focal plane (BFP) was added to give angular variations of the EDF image over a small range giving an effective 3D perspective of the sample.

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.16.020306" title="Optically sectioned imaging by oblique plane microscopy; C. Dunsby; Optics Express, vol 16(25), p20306-20316, (2008)">Dunsby 2008</a>]

modified the DORR concept to invent the oblique plane microscopy (OPM) modality, which enables light-sheet illumination and collection from a single high-NA objective. This breakthrough resulted in a true ‘single objective’ light sheet microscope, removing the many drawbacks of multi-objective systems but with the inherent limitation of lower effective resolution and collection efficiency due to the tilted arrangement of the optics. For oil immersion objectives, this equates to a maximum effective numerical aperture of about 1, with a ~50% loss in fluorescence signal.</p>

<p>
[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1364/OL.34.001504" title="Real-time slit scanning microscopy in the meridional plane; E.J. Botcherby, M.J. Booth, R. Juškaitis and T. Wilson; Optics Letters, vol 34(10), p1504-1506, (2009)">Botcherby 2009</a>]

used SORR in combination with a line-illumination and slit confocal microscope arrangement, including a secondary scanning mirror, to pack lines onto the camera and produce high frame rates in the meridional or Z-plane of the sample. This SORR setup had the usual drawback of ~50% signal loss due to the polarizing beam splitter (PBS) cube, but was a nice early demonstration of how RR can be appended to an existing imaging platform.

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.103.257803" title="Liquid Crystal Director Dynamics Imaged Using Two-Photon Fluorescence Microscopy with Remote Focusing; P.S. Salter, G. Carbone, E.J. Botcherby, T. Wilson, S.J. Elston and E.P. Raynes; Phys. Rev. Lett., vol 103(25), 257803, (2009)">Salter 2009</a>]

Luo, J.J. Field, K.E. Sheetz, A.W. Sylvester and J.A. Squier; Biomedical Optics Express, vol 2(1), p113-122, (2011)">Hoover 2011</a>]

used SORR with their differential multiphoton microscopy technique to give agile Z-adjustment, and

improved on the original OPM setup by coupling the excitation through the RR so that the light sheet and image plane can be simultaneously swept through the sample in a remote fashion to give inherently synchronized imaging at high volumetric frame rates.

[<a class="citation" href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1109111108" title="Three-dimensional imaging and photostimulation by remote-focusing and holographic light patterning; F. Anselmi, C. Ventalon, A. Bègue, D. Ogden and V. Emiliani; PNAS, vol 108(49), p19504-19509, (2011)">Anselmi 2011</a>]

combined SORR with 3D holographic stimulation and introduced a novel tilt of the RR scan mirror that is similar in concept to the OPM setup, and allows imaging of tunable oblique planes in the sample. The paper also offers a thorough quantification of RR performance with the optics used in the experiment confirming the analysis of the original paper

use SORR to give fast Z-scanning of a light sheet that is imaged by a second orthogonal objective in their axially swept light sheet microscope (ASLM). Because the SORR is on the excitation path with abundant coherent polarized light, there is no important loss from the PBS which nicely demonstrates the use of a penalty-free RR arrangement.</p>
